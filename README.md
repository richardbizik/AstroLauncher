<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

**Recommended: Most people will want to just run the .exe, check out the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ricky-davis/AstroLauncher/releases/latest) for a download of the executable.**


<br/>
To get a local "from-source" copy up and running follow these simple steps:
<br/>
<br/>

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7
- pip / pipenv

### Installation

1. Clone the AstroLauncher repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ricky-davis/AstroLauncher.git
```

2. Install python modules using pip or pipenv

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
pipenv install
```

<br />

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Run the server launcher using the following command

```sh
pipenv run python AstroLauncher.py
```

<br /><br />
If not placed in the same directory as the server files, you can specify a server folder location like so

```sh
python AstroLauncher.py --path "steamapps\common\ASTRONEER Dedicated Server"
```

```sh
pipenv run python AstroLauncher.py -p "steamapps\common\ASTRONEER Dedicated Server"
```

<br />

### Building an EXE

1. If you want to turn this project into an executable, make sure to install pyinstaller using one of the following methods

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

```sh
pipenv install -d
```

2. Run pyinstaller with the all-in-one flag

```sh
pyinstaller AstroLauncher.py -F --add-data "assets;./assets" --icon=assets/astrolauncherlogo.ico
```

or just run the BuildEXE.py which automatically cleans up afterwards

```sh
python BuildEXE.py
```

1. Move the executable (in the new `dist` folder) to the directory of your choice. (If you want you can now delete the `dist` and `build` folders, as well as the `.spec` file)
2. Run AstroLauncher.exe

```sh
AstroLauncher.exe -p "steamapps\common\ASTRONEER Dedicated Server"
```
